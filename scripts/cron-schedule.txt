# MCP Release Status Automation Cron Schedule
#
# NOTE: This file is DEPRECATED. We now use launchd + pmset for scheduling,
# which allows the Mac to wake from sleep to run the job.
# See README.md for the current setup using:
#   - ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mcp.release-status.plist
#   - sudo pmset repeat wakeorpoweron MTWRF 11:10:00
#
# Legacy cron schedule (for reference only):
# 15 11 * * 1-5 /Users/olegshevchenko/Sourses/MCP/scripts/cron-release-wrapper.sh

# To install this schedule:
# crontab /Users/olegshevchenko/Sourses/MCP/scripts/cron-schedule.txt
#
# To view current cron jobs:
# crontab -l
#
# To remove all cron jobs:
# crontab -r

# Alternative schedules (for reference, currently commented out):
#

# 0 9,11,13,15,17 * * 1-5 /Users/olegshevchenko/Sourses/MCP/scripts/cron-release-wrapper.sh
